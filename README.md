Unofficial OpenAI GPT-3 Python client.
=========

I wrote this up in a couple hours to use the rest API openAI has made available in their beta. I then saw they have
an official client, but maybe this is still helpful to someone. It now includes some helper libraries for generating
dialog like in their Playground "chatbot", but it can generate both sides of the the conversation turns.

Official Client Alternative.

There's already an official client you can use. `pip install openai`
