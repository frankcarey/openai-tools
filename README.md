Unofficial OpenAI GPT-3 Python client.
=========

I wrote this up in a couple hours to use the rest API openAI has made available in their beta. I then saw they have
an official client, but maybe this is still helpful to someone.

Official Client Alternative.
-----------
There's already an official client you can use. `pip install openai`
